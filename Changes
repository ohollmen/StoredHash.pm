# 0.025
Initial Release with full packaging (3 tests, pod missing)

# 0.026
- Added proto of Child / Tree loading (experimental interface)
- Tuned up pod documentation

# 0.027
- Public release candidate for preview

# 0.028
- Initial public release
- Last minute pod cleanups

# 0.029
- Skip test 03... when missing non-CORE module DBD::CSV Instead of
  adding mandatory dependency to DBD::CSV
- Uncommented $dbh->do("create table ...") to make it easier to copy-paste
  the SYSNOPSIS as a working example

# 0.030
- Fixed documentation of update() to clearly state the return value
  (this could previously be derived only from source code).
- Changed methods to throw exceptions with a strong deprecation of
errstr() setter/getter method. Run persistence methods in eval to protect
calling code, catch exceptions.
- Fixed debug messaged to go (consistently) into STDERR.


# 0.31
- Itegrate POD into code and deprecate use of home-brew comments extraction system
- Add (an ugly) $StoredHash::hardval class variable to work around FreeTDS / MSSQL 80 character truncation problem with prepared statements. Set to true value $StoredHash::hardval causes SQL to use literal (escaped) values in SQL instead of parametrized prepared statements.
